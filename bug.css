The CSS property `calc()` is used to perform calculations within CSS. However, sometimes unexpected results occur due to incorrect spacing or operator precedence. For example, `width: calc(100% - 20px);` works correctly, but `width:calc(100% - 20px)` (missing space after `calc()`) may not.  Another issue can happen with nested `calc()` functions, where the order of operations might lead to unexpected outcomes.   Incorrect unit usage is another problem, mixing percentages, pixels, and ems without correct conversions can cause unexpected results.
